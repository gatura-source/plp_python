Dataset Suggestions:

You can use publicly available datasets from sites like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The Iris dataset (a classic dataset for classification problems) can be accessed via sklearn.datasets.load_iris(), which can be used for the analysis.

Plot Customization:

Customize the plots using the matplotlib library to add titles, axis labels, and legends.
Use seaborn for additional plotting styles, which can make your charts more visually appealing.

Error Handling:

Handle possible errors during the file reading (e.g., file not found), missing data, or incorrect data types by using exception-handling mechanisms (try, except).

Submission:

Ensure your submission is complete with all necessary code and explanations. Make sure that each plot is properly labeled and provides insights into the dataset.
